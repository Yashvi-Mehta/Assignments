                    <p>Mission Education is a national level programme of Smile Foundation, which is committed to
                        providing
                        basic education and
                        healthcare to underprivileged children. Smile Foundation believes that whether you are
                        addressing
                        healthcare, poverty,
                        population control, unemployment or human rights, there's no better place to start than in the
                        corridors
                        of education.

                        Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life; means, because it empowers an
                        individual to earn
                        his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from
                        healthcare to
                        appropriate social behavior to understanding one's rights, and in the process evolve as a better
                        citizen.

                        Smile Foundation’s educational initiatives include Pre-school [3-6 yrs], Non Formal Education
                        [6-14
                        yrs

                        going], Remedial Education [6-14 yrs school going] and Bridge Course [14-18 yrs drop-outs]. It
                        works
                        for
                        education for
                        underprivileged children who are under difficult circumstances, such as child labour, children
                        of
                        poorest of the
                        parents, children inflicted and affected with HIV/AIDS, street and runaway children, children
                        with
                        rare
                        disabilities,
                        disaster struck children and slum children. Special emphasis is given on girl education and
                        women
                        education, so that
                        they and their families get empowered.

                        Since its inception in 2002, more than 200,000 underprivileged children have directly benefitted
                        from
                        the Mission
                        Education programme.

                    <p>“He who has health has hope; and he who has hope has everything” – Arabic proverb

                        India has made rapid strides in the health sector since independence. However, various eye
                        opening
                        data
                        from NFHS
                        clearly indicate that access to healthcare still remains a challenge.

                        While the health statistics of rural India continue to be poor, the health status and access to
                        health
                        for the poor in
                        urban slum dwellers has surfaced to be equally deplorable and have less than 4% of government
                        primary
                        healthcare
                        facilities.

                        Urban slum dwellers suffer from adverse health conditions owing to mainly two reasons –first the
                        lack of
                        education and
                        thus lack of awareness; and second the unwillingness to lose a day’s wage in order to reach the
                        nearest
                        medical
                        facility. Healthcare for underprivileged, which is a desperate need, thus remains unaddressed.

                        The need of the hour is thus a two pronged approach – first to bring quality healthcare services
                        to
                        doorsteps of the
                        needy and second to promote healthcare awareness and contemporary healthcare seeking behavior
                        among
                        the
                        underprivileged.

                        In such a scenario a mobile healthcare services delivery system is the most practical mechanism.
                        And
                        in
                        subscription to
                        this view, Smile Foundation has initiated the Smile on Wheels programme. This is a unique mobile
                        hospital programme that
                        seeks to address problems of mobility, accessibility and availability of primary healthcare with
                        a
                        special focus on
                        children and women, in urban slums and remote rural areas.

                        The Smile on Wheels programme has so far provided free healthcare services to more than 10 lakh
                        children
                        and families.

                <div>
                    <img src="../Images/swabhiman.jpg">
                    <p>Various studies, as well as our experience, have shown that when we work towards women
                        empowerment,
                        the
                        whole society
                        benefits. But unfortunately in India, far from being empowered, most women are denied even their
                        basic
                        rights like
                        health, education, employment and a respectable status in society.

                        According to a recent UNDP Human Development Report, India has a dangerously imbalanced sex
                        ratio,
                        the
                        chief reason
                        being rampant female infanticide and sex-selective abortions.

                        Swabhiman, meaning self-respect in English, was initiated in 2005 to address these challenges
                        through a
                        simple yet
                        effective approach. The programme is specifically aimed at realization of both individual and
                        collective
                        self-esteem and
                        inner strength for marginalised and socially excluded women and adolescent girls through
                        innovative
                        community practices.

                        A tailor-made strategy called the ‘4 S Model’ has been developed under Swabhiman for women
                        empowerment.
                        The ‘4 S Model’
                        is an acronym for four novel approaches, namely Seeking Healthcare as a Behaviour, Support for
                        Education, Supporters
                        through Male Involvement, and Sustaining the Change in Communities.

                        The programme identifies adolescent girls and women from the community and develops them into
                        Change
                        Agents, who in turn
                        actively contribute to the community mobilization process.

                        So far, Swabhiman has successfully made a difference to the lives of over 500,000 women and girl
                        children.

                    <p>Children are the future of a nation. They are the best change agents, be it in the family or the
                        community in which they live. It is therefore crucial to help the children when young and
                        inculcate in them feelings of empathy and conscience so that they grow up as responsible
                        individuals.
                        Sensitization of privileged children and their parents, towards the
                        existing inequalities
                        around them, is an important objective of CFC.

                        Privileged children are sensitized about the deprivation and pain endured by the underprivileged
                        kids.
                        CFC seeks to
                        inculcate a conscience and value system in the children so that they grow up to become
                        responsible
                        citizens and change
                        makers. Before their minds are set with age, the CFC programme tries to make them count their
                        own
                        blessings and
                        understand the plight of less privileged ones. Once they start realizing the worth of the
                        privileges
                        they are born with,
                        they automatically turn their thoughts towards positivity and develop the right outlook. This
                        eventually
                        helps them
                        develop into not only successful but responsible individuals in life. They grow up to become
                        significant
                        change makers,
                        who contribute positively to the society.

                    <p>The youth comprises over one-third of the Indian population which in turn constitutes a major
                        part of
                        the
                        labour force
                        of the country. The number of underprivileged youth in India who lacks education and proper
                        guidance
                        is
                        so huge that
                        according to the reports of the Financial Express only 15% of the young graduates passing out of
                        colleges are
                        employable; the rest are branded unemployable.

                        It is not their lack of theoretical knowledge that causes this. Instead, it is the lack of right
                        skills
                        and attitude.
                        There is thus, an increasing concern among the leading employers of the country, about the
                        dearth of
                        ready-to-deliver
                        employees. In addition, the macro perspective affirms that, it is crucial for the energy of the
                        underprivileged youth to
                        be channelized properly with proper direction to aid economic growth and nation building to
                        elude
                        their
                        addition to
                        family woes, social stress and national misery.
