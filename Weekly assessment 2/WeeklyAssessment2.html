                    Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain
                    Coffea species. The genus
                    Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and
                    Madagascar, the Comoros,
                    Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.[2] Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70
                    countries, primarily in the
                    equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two most
                    commonly grown are C.
                    arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee
                    seeds (referred to as
                    "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground
                    and then brewed with
                    near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

                    You can make this type of coffee quite simply by adding hot water to a shot of espresso coffee. It
                    has been said that
                    American soldiers during the Second World War would make this type of coffee to make their beverages
                    last longer. It was
                    then (apparently) adopted by American baristas after the war.

                        Possibly the most popular type of coffee in the world, a cappuccino consists of three layers
                        (kind
                        of like a cake). The
                        first is a shot of espresso, then a shot of steamed milk, and finally the barista adds a layer
                        of
                        frothed, foamy milk.
                        This final layer can also be topped with chocolate shavings or powder. Traditionally, Italians
                        would
                        consume this type
                        of coffee at breakfast
                    </p>

                    A macchiato is a shot of espresso which is then topped off
                    with foamed milk dashed directly into the
                    cup. Although it
                    may sound similar to a cappuccino, it’s usually
                    stronger as there’s no steamed milk added and it’s
                    also smaller, usually
                    served in an expresso sized cup.
